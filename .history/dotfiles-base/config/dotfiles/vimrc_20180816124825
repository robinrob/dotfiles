    " Filetype processing does happen, so we can detect a buffer initially
    " loaded during :argdo / :bufdo through a set filetype, but missing
    " b:current_syntax. Also don't do this when the user explicitly turned off
    " syntax highlighting via :syntax off.
    " The following autocmd is triggered twice:
    " 1. During the :...do iteration, where it is inactive, because
    " 'eventignore' includes "Syntax". This speeds up the iteration itself.
    " 2. After the iteration, when the user re-enters a buffer / window that was
    " loaded during the iteration. Here is becomes active and enables syntax
    " highlighting. Since that is done buffer after buffer, the delay doesn't
    " matter so much.
    " Note: When the :...do command itself edits the window (e.g. :argdo
    " tabedit), the BufWinEnter event won't fire and enable the syntax when the
    " window is re-visited. We need to hook into WinEnter, too. Note that for
    " :argdo split, each window only gets syntax highlighting as it is entered.
    " Alternatively, we could directly activate the normally effectless :syntax
    " enable through :set eventignore-=Syntax, but that would also cause the
    " slowdown during the iteration Vim wants to avoid.
    " Note: Must allow nesting of autocmds so that the :syntax enable triggers
    " the ColorScheme event. Otherwise, some highlighting groups may not be
    " restored properly.
